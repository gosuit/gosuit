# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

GoSuit is a collection of tools for GoLang development. It is designed to simplify the routine things in writing an application, so that you can focus on the business logic as much as possible.

You can see the principles we follow, the clean architecture, and examples of using tools in [**GoTemplate**](https://github.com/gosuit/go-template).
